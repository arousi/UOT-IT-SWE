## Overview
This repository contains all the materials related to the Software Engineering Department courses, including lectures, practical sessions, projects, and code examples.

Feel free to study from it, it is made for this particular purpose :)

## General Subject Courses
To graduate smoothly from the department, the following courses should be:

1. Understood and become comfortable in
2. Pass with a minimum of C

The Deparment usually filters who can specialize in by the `GPA` and their scores in the General programming courses, thus maintaining a gpa of `B` and passing those courses with a `B` is a gurantee for your preference.

Regardless of your preference, you should always have a #2 Depratment that you are ellegible for.

Usually students who don't qualify for the `dept of SWE` specilize in `dept of Web Tech` then transfer after first Semester. Though i wouldn't recommend such a bypass to the rules.

This move would also delay your graduation by 1 semester, and if we count for your life events and you failing some courses from the faculty for whatever reason, weill sum up to `2 semesters delay`. and that is a big risk you wouldn't want to take.
1. It will get you lower in the ladder of Scholraships Applicants
2. Will not be liked by your lectrerus -whom would become your `Grad Project Supervisor` evantually, and
3. Will delay your career/academic life by a full year

So aim to getting at least 6 Courses each sem, get the dept courses first, pass them with a B, and get a good reputation in the faculty for any future occasion.

Some software and tools I recommend to know before you enroll:
1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI/UX in HCI Course
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), for developing Java and other courses languages and frameworks
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), as it is the main form of proving your work in most courses
4. [MS Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) or [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), LaTeX is a bonus for working on reports
5. [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), for the Elective course

## Courses Structure
The courses are organized into:
- core
- elective 

Each course folder contains subfolders for assignments, projects, and lecture notes.

### Core Courses
The core courses are essential for the Software Engineering curriculum. Here are some of the core courses available:
1. `ITSE311` Req Analysis
2. `ITSE312` DataBase2
3. `ITSE412` Net2
4. `ITSE322` Adv Java

Focus on passing the courses that open the `ITSE500` Course, aka `Grad Project` , Later on you will thank me :)
